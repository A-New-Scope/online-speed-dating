# Template -- name of the thing this doc is about goes here

This is wehre an overview of the technology will go. Summarize what it does and why you used it.
This is a template designed to guide the creation of documents about the various technologies
used throughout the project.

##Official Documentation
Official Documentation for this tool can be found at [Name of tool](https://officialdocsfortool.docs/)

##Quick Tips
* Make a list of important things to note
* Either things that were used frequently
* Or particulary tricky points you encountered

##How It Works 
Describe here how the tool works, what it's purpose is. This is a fleshed out version
of the intial overview. Sort of a miniature tutorial or guide of the basics of the 
tool.

#Used Together With
* A list with links [to the other tools we used that work together with this](NameOfTool.md)
* If there isn't a document that you made yourself, [link to the official docs](https://officialdocs.ohyeah)
* This list should essentially be a subset of the initial [Tech Stack, API's and Third-party Tools list in the README](Linktoadocument)

##Our Implementation
Describe the specific use of the tool in our app here. Code examples will follow this section,
so this can be more of an overview of how you implemented the tool within the app, why you used it specifically
and what functions it is serving.

##Code Examples
This is where you run through examples of code from the project to demonstrate how the 
tool is used. These could be the common use cases/patterns in the project as well as particularly
difficult or unique implementations. Also possibly include notes where further functionality is possible
but hasn't been implemented. Links to the related sections of the official docs would be [incredibly helpful](https://officialdocs.docparty)
Code examples are formatted like this:
Indented four spaces:
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
Or using 'code fencing':
```
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
If you want syntax highlighting, include the language: 

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
``` 

Inline code uses tics like `<div>html is here</div>`

##Visual Aids
This section is more optional, use if you think there are diagrams or other visuals
that will assist in the understanding of how a tool works/how you used it

#Other Resources
This section to [link](https://resource.com) to other resources outside of the official docs.
This could include articles about the tool that helped, tutorials, guides, example projects, 
or other resources that helped you figure out how to use the tool an guided your implementation of 
it for the app.
